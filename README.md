The research project will involve the implementation of advanced machine learning methods to
portfolio allocation, with the aim of designing adaptive investment strategies based on data that
maximizes returns and minimizes risks in a real-time setting. These traditional asset allocation
methods typically utilize past data and expert judgment which may work against them due to potential
lack of adaptability and responding to the abnormal economic environment. And, when it comes to
machine learning (in particular deep learning), this offers nothing but dynamic and automate out of
the box. These algorithms can take in a massive amount of data and detect the subtlest patterns,
enabling them to modify portfolios instantly - thus improving both return and risk management.
This literature review will research what work has been done with machine learning, more specifically
the application of methods as LSTM networks, XGBoost and Random Forest for portfolio allocation.
The findings by these studies have shown that machine learning models are able to uncover intricate
financial data structures and subsequently apply this knowledge within more stable and adaptive
investment strategies. With a working experience of these methodologies, this review will investigate
how and to what extent they collectively enhance the portfolio optimization and risk management in
order to provide a detailed view on its strengths, limitations and future potential behavior.
